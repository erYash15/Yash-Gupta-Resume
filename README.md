# Yash-Gupta-Resume

I am currently a final year student studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur. As a part of a compulsory internship, I am working as a Data Science Intern at the Pay1 â€“ Mindsarray Network Private Limited, Mumbai where I work on Machine learning and its application in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I was able to squeeze in some internships in the past as well, notable among them is at IIT-BHU in 2019. On a side for fun I make projects (Yes, that's what I do...). I also guide several undergrad students as a co-founder of the Coding Club at IIIT, Nagpur.

Apart from being a data scientist, I enjoy most of my time being indoors. I am a foodie, Cinemaphiles, and Gaming Addict. I also love watching YouTube for comedy and knowledge. I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technological advancements in the world especially related to gaming and artificial intelligence.
