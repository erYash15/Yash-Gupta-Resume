Thanks to visit my Profile:

• I am currently working in Tata Consultancy Services as Data Scientist.

• I was able to squeeze in some internships in the past as well, notable among them being at IIT-BHU in 2019. 
• On a side for fun I make projects (Yes, that's what I do...). I also guide several undergrad students as a co-founder of the Dot-Slash Coding Club. I am also a competitive coder 4stars @CodeChef.
